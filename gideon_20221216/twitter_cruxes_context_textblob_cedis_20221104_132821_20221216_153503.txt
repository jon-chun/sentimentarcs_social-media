@TheAdvo72281022 @ElosiubaAugust1 @julietibrahim No, it’s 72k Naira = 140k cedis. What you should be talking about is the purchasing power. Cedis is not strong and your economy is in shambles

@lydiaforson I used to spend 120 cedis on electricity each month but all of a sudden 250 cedis barely last a month. It’s just crazy
@julietibrahim @DangoteOfData If Nigeria did what Ghana did (taking zeros off their currency) that 72,000 Naira would actually be 72 Naira. 

So in actual sense, that your 1400 Cedis is really 1,400,000 Cedis. Direct your question/comparison to somewhere else!

@julietibrahim @Swit_Morenikemi Some people need to understand that Naira has more value than the Cedis, the only thing confusing is the many zeros on Naira just like the Cedis had in the past until the re-denomination in 2007.                        100 Cedis is same as 10,000 Naira but what 10,000 can do the
